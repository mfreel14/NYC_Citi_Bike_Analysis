## Project Overview - (Project Name)
The key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis to decide if a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

With Tableau we will create a story with our analysis visualizations that show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders and the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.  We will also show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.  With some additional visualizations we'll create a final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

When comparing trips by gender with the heat map, Females were most often to start a trip at 6:00pm on Thursdays with 11,336 rides.  Females were least likley to start a trip on Tuesday at 3:00am with 41 rides. 

For Males, the most popular trip start time was 6:00pm on Thursday with 30,749 rides.  The least popular trip start time for Males was on Tuesday at 3:00am with 277 rides.

When comparing trips by weekday by gender we can see that subscribers are more likley to ride on any given day compared to regular customers.

Thursday for both male and female subscribers is the most popular day for trips.

The total of rides for the data set is 2,344,224.  From those rides 'Subscriber' accounted for 1,900,359 and 'Customer' accounted for 443,865.

## Citi Bike Analysis  - Summary
Based on the results we can determine that Males account for the majority of rides followed by Females and Unknown.  The large majority of rides come from those who are 'Subscribers'.  The data also tells us that Thursdays at 6:0pm is the most popular day and time for rides.

Further analysis would provide more insight for decision making.  An additional visualization comparing city population between NYC and Des Moines would be helpful to understand forcast on monetary returns.  

Another visualization would be to compare the weather between both cities to better understand the impact, if any, on the relationship between bike rides and weather.
